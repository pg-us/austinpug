            <hr>
            <p>
							This group serves as the Austin chapter of PostgreSQL user groups, a community supported gathering of postgres users new and experienced alike.
						</p><p>
							We strive to create a collaborative environment for the growth of our interaction with PostgreSQL and the PostgreSQL community as a whole. We
							organize events locally as well as abroad during global Postgres conferences, discuss topics that are interesting and exciting, give
							informative/educational presentations, and participate in global community type events (Patch Days, reporting bugs, etc).
						</p><p>
							Some of our key members are highly active individuals in the postgres community that participate heavily in the advancement of the database
							service. All are welcome, and we always love new faces. We cater to both the expert and the newbie, and the topics we cover are covered from
							that standpoint as well.This is a great place to learn how to use postgres and to gain some hands-on training with some very knowledgable
							individuals, share in a wealth of experience, and so on.
